Describe a TM M which has input x and writes |x|² in binary.

For example:
 – 00 would 100
 – 0000 would write 10000

Answer:

Define M as a 3-tape Turing Machine with the following behavior:
- M takes in input x and uses the solution to HW6 #4 to encode the length in binary
  on a work tape (call it work tape A) and the output tape.
- Now, it adds the encoded length to itself and writes that to the output tape.
  It can add itself by following the gradeschool algorithm.
- Repeat the step above for every character in the input.
